The staff at the Center for Holistic Gaming is passionate about your well-being throughout all aspects of your daily, gaming life. We understand that it is a constant and ongoing process to actively avoid adulting through immersion in gaming activities. We are here to help. Through educational and participatory tabletop, board, and video game sessions, we strive to provide you with whole-body knowledge and tools to combat the daily trials of reality.
