My niece and her mother (my sister) had a raucous discussion of `random strangers`.  The `randomness` of these individuals intrigued me because (in my dealings with the universe) I always assumed that strangers were necessarily, and indeed, quite intentionally put there to be strange to me.  Thus, in my assumption, strangers are not random because how could they be "just friends I have not met yet"?  Friends are not random, friends are part of a divine plan made special just for me, correct?

I jest, there is no divine plan; but plenty of random divinity. Thus, I considered the concept of `specific strangers`. This would be a person who you have seen numerous times yet they remain unknown to you and therefore, strange.  Then again, why is it that people we do not know are `strangers`? Such an unknown person could very well be normal, in fact they could be outrageously common and boring.  That type of person would be decidedly not strange and likely quite the underwhelming presence at a party. Would it be then that after un-stranging a person they should become a `knowner`? This individual has not been promoted to a friend but have managed to claw their way from the wastelands of the strange. This person may be called an `aquaintance` in some circles but I have not managed yet to acquaint myself with them so they can relish in being simply known by me. Still, should a particularly bold and persistent individual rise to the status of `friend` and somehow keep their strangeness in tact, what then? My dear strange friend may very well be stranger than I and my thoughts exactly; how random that would be.
