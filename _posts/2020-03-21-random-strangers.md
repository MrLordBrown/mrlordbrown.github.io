My niece and her mother (my sister) had a racous discussion of `random strangers`.  The `randomness` of these individuals intrigued me because (in my dealings with the universe) I always assumed that strangers were necessarily, and indeed, quite intentionally put there to be strange to me.  Thus, in my assumption, strangers are not random because how could they be "just friends I have not met yet"?  Friends are not random, friends are part of a devine plan made special just me, correct?

I jest, there is no devine plan, obviously. Thus, I considered the concept of `specific strangers`. This would be a person who you have seen numerous times yet they remain unknown to you and therefore, strange.  In fact, why is it that people we do not know are `strangers`? Such an unknown person could very well be normal, in fact they could be outrageously common and boring.  That type of person would be decidedly not strange.
